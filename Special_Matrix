function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
A = zeros(n,m);
if nargin == 2
    for i = 1:m
        A(1,i) = i;
        i + 1;
    end

    for j = 1:n
        A(j,1) = j;
        j + 1;
    end

    for k = 2:m
        for l = 2:n
            A(l,k) = A(l-1,k) + A(l,k-1);
            l + 1;
        end
        k + 1;
    end
% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A

else
