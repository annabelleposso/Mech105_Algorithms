% Define the function to be solved for. Is the angle specified in radians or degrees?

% THINK, what makes range sense for angle?

% Plot your function. Does plotting give you an idea about where the root is?

% Finaly solve for the root using the bisection script given to you, which can be called as:
%[root, fx,For the following problem, consider the Taylor Series: 

LaTeX: f\left(x_{i+1\:}\right)=\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\:\frac{f^n\left(x_i\right)}{n!}h^n

f(x) = 4x3 â€“ 2

xi = 2

xi+1 = 4

What is the true relative error associated with the estimate using the 1st order Taylor series estimate of f(xi+1) about xi? ea, iter] = bisect(func, lower_bound, upper_bound);

% These variables will be checked for your final answer:
%angle =  % the angle in degree that solves this problem
%fx =     % the function value at your solved angle
%ea =     % the bisection error estimate
%iter =   % the number of bisection iterations
